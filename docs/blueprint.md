## Core Features:

- Google Drive Integration: Connects the application to Google Drive for secure storage and retrieval of notes.
- Class Selection: Allows users to select a class from 1 to 10 to filter notes.
- Subject Filtering: Enables users to filter notes by subject within a selected class.
- Lesson/Topic Navigation: Organizes notes under specific lessons or topics for easy access.
- Content Viewer: Displays content from Google Drive, including PDFs, Word documents, MP3s, and video files, directly within the app using Google Drive's embeddable viewer tool to handle various document formats, when possible. Plain text is directly displayed in the content viewer, formatted with markdown as needed.
